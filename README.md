# 📖 Project Overview

The 🎵 Song Analytics dashboard is an interactive Business Intelligence application developed using **Python** and **Streamlit**.

The project performs **historical descriptive analytics** on Atlantic_Records playlist data, enabling users to explore playlist performance, artist dominance, popularity trends, content characteristics, and executive business insights through an intuitive dashboard.

Unlike recommendation systems or predictive machine learning applications, this dashboard focuses on transforming historical playlist data into actionable business intelligence through interactive visualization and professional reporting.
